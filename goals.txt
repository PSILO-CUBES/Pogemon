            wrong affliction lights up after using item in battle

            itemUsed still true after item used reset

            poison fainting doesnt end battle

            using potion during battle fucks up bag sprites, makes the game fucky after battle too -- multiple animations are fired at once which causes the "fucky" effect

            statusEffectAnimation fires multiple times -- leech seed animation spazed out -- related to problem above?? multiple animation playing at the same time would cause a problem like that

            can move during cancel renaming -- sometimes
        }

        other stuff:{
            remove cursor: pointer from bag pogemon container when not highlighted -- sometimes happens idk when

            didint test unaware but 80% sure it works

            80% sure magic bounce / synchronize interaction works properly

            didint test black sludge

            teleport gem teleports to weird ass places when tping -- related spawnPosition being reassinged when there is a save file or pogecenterReturnInfo stuff found

            put looking direction on changeMap collisions so i dont get in by accident

            target not defined classes.js:2996 -- after battle cant move


            -- gab tested buggs

            remember to set owMenu back to enabled every time!!!!!!!!! -- check where it is fired with Gab

            keep trees and rocks destroyed, also starter pogeball reappears for some reason ??

            ow items respawn sometimes

            queue exp event, setTimeout not a good idea should push in queue no matter what, poison affliciton happens at the wrong time beacuse of it -- stats change interaction in conflict with this one

            learning quick attack when already known

            gene_Town level is always the same
        }

        reminder :{
            i think most battle issues at this point are just not checking for fainting and not switching / leaving battle when foe faints

            poison issues confuse issues need to be checked manualy

            check if bag scene and ow scene animation active and cancel the animation if not

            make heisenberg give the halo as in itemPickup thingy
        }
    }

    test:{
        sweet kiss animation wont play

        moon light might not work

        switch out on last pogemon and battle ended even tho the opponent didint faint

        wild battle restarted with previous fainted pogemon, hp was at 0 and was the same pogemon

        enemy pogemon uses old move when i switch x

        poison damage delt to me instead of wild mon after catch -- calling checkStatusEvent on wrong target in catch method x

        tadtoxic doenst showup in pogedex until relaod x

        tadtoxic stays 0 brightness even when seen x

        check when ally pogemon faints, 3 queues happen should shave those off x


        poison : {
            was poisoned could be a bit later

            enemy poison happens before i faint??? <-- aint this normal wtf?? -- ally dont faint after switching when opponent is poisoned -- 
            faint message doesnt display but the switching still happens -- kinda dont care that it happens that way, if it fucks with other events ill have to check it out tho x
